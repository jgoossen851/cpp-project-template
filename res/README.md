# `res/`

Contents from the [Pitchfork standard](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?force=1&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork/develop/data/spec.bs#tld.extras).

## Purpose

Directory containing non-source code aspects of the project. This might include graphics and markup files.

## Notes

This directory is not required.

The `data/` directory is designated for holding project files which should be included in revision control, but are not explicitly code. For example, graphics and localization files are not code in the same sense as the rest of the project, but are good candidates for inclusion in the `data/` directory.

The structure and layout of this directory is not prescribed by this document.
